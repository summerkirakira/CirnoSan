For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.",

For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.",

For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.",

For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.",

For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.",

For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.",

Their history speaks for itself as the famed laboratory is accredited for the standardization of laser weaponry and dozens of other innovations.
