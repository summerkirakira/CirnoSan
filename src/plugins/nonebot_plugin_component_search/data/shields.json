He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.","ref":"435366d8-8b47-4cbc-b0cf-688a95a0847d","calculatorName":"YORM"}}},"localName":"shld_yorm_s01_falco_scitem"},{"calculatorType":"shield","data":{"health":200,"maxLifetimeHours":22,"type":"Shield","size":1,"grade":"B","name":"ForceWall","description":"Want to stay in the thick of battle a bit longer?

Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.","ref":"435366d8-8b47-4cbc-b0cf-688a95a0847d","calculatorName":"YORM"}}},"localName":"shld_yorm_s01_targa_scitem"},{"calculatorType":"shield","data":{"health":262.5,"maxLifetimeHours":32,"type":"Shield","size":2,"grade":"B","name":"6MA 'Kozane'","description":"Behring’s ironclad reputation is almost as impenetrable as the shield produced by the 6MA ‘Kozane’.

Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.","ref":"435366d8-8b47-4cbc-b0cf-688a95a0847d","calculatorName":"YORM"}}},"localName":"shld_yorm_s02_bamoty_scitem"},{"calculatorType":"shield","data":{"health":275,"maxLifetimeHours":22,"type":"Shield","size":2,"grade":"B","name":"BLOC","description":"Seal Corporation’s BLOC shield generator was the first to use the company’s revolutionary quantum core semiconductor to reduce the component’s power draw without compromising performance.","mass":1000,"ref":"cd1ed528-ce0f-4aaa-8ae3-370c48f97d9f","heat":{"temperatureToIR":1,"startIRTemperature":250,"overpowerHeat":0,"overclockThresholdMinHeat":0,"overclockThresholdMaxHeat":0,"thermalEnergyBase":47335.5,"thermalEnergyDraw":49500,"thermalConductivity":0.05,"specificHeatCapacity":0.5,"mass":1000,"surfaceArea":0.05,"startCoolingTemperature":300,"maxCoolingRate":98.1342,"maxTemperature":700,"overheatTemperature":650,"recoveryTemperature":550,"minTemperature":0,"misfireMinTemperature":300,"misfireMaxTemperature":900},"power":{"powerBase":1000,"powerDraw":1400,"timeToReachDrawRequest":0,"safeguardPriority":10,"isThrottleable":true,"isOverclockable":false,"overclockThresholdMin":0,"overclockThresholdMax":0,"overpowerPerformance":0,"overclockPerformance":0,"powerToEM":10,"decayRateOfEM":0.2,"warningDelayTime":0.3,"warningDisplayTime":8},"distortion":{"decayDelay":1.5,"decayRate":5,"maximum":672.1,"warningRatio":0.75,"recoveryRatio":0.32,"powerRatioAtMaxDistortion":false,"powerChangeOnlyAtMaxDistortion":false},"shield":{"maxShieldHealth":9900,"maxShieldRegen":550,"regenExcessMax":0,"regenExcessChargePerSec":10,"regenExcessUseCooldown":5,"decayRatio":0.25,"downedRegenDelay":5,"damagedRegenDelay":5,"resistance":{"physicalMin":0,"physicalMax":0.25,"energyMin":0,"energyMax":0.25,"distortionMin":0,"distortionMax":0.25,"thermalMin":0,"thermalMax":0,"biochemicalMin":0,"biochemicalMax":0,"stunMin":0,"stunMax":0},"absorption":{"physicalMin":0.5,"physicalMax":0.95,"energyMin":1,"energyMax":1,"distortionMin":1,"distortionMax":1,"thermalMin":1,"thermalMax":1,"biochemicalMin":1,"biochemicalMax":1,"stunMin":1,"stunMax":1}},"class":"Civilian","manufacturerData":{"calculatorType":"manufacturer","data":{"nameSmall":"SECO","name":"Seal Corporation","description":"One of the earliest companies to begin selling energy based shielding to civilians when the technology was declassified, Seal Corp has been in the industry centuries longer than its current modern day competition.

Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.","ref":"435366d8-8b47-4cbc-b0cf-688a95a0847d","calculatorName":"YORM"}}},"localName":"shld_yorm_s02_haltur_scitem"},{"calculatorType":"shield","data":{"health":250,"maxLifetimeHours":45,"type":"Shield","size":2,"grade":"A","name":"Rampart","description":"Basilisk understands that escape isn’t always an option.

For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.","ref":"435366d8-8b47-4cbc-b0cf-688a95a0847d","calculatorName":"YORM"}}},"localName":"shld_yorm_s02_trenta_scitem"},{"calculatorType":"shield","data":{"health":787.5,"maxLifetimeHours":64,"type":"Shield","size":3,"grade":"B","name":"6CA 'Bila'","description":"“Built by Behring” is a phrase synonymous with quality.
