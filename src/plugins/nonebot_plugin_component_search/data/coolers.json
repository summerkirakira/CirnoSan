While, over time, as competition increased, their share of the ship market shrank, their components had earned a reputation for dependability and ease of maintenance. Their direct sales of these components soon made up the majority of the companies income and in 2513, the ceased ship manufacture entirely to focus on supplying industrial strength components.

The second is a more recent usage in that it refers to the start-up manufacturing company who took the phrase as their epithet. ACOM focuses on creating ship components that handle as much power as possible as quickly as possible in order to give pilots the all-important extra edge during a race. Founded by the children of famed pit crew chief Garrit Bijarani, siblings Jayce and Zan took four generations of racing knowledge and gave it form in ACOM’s full line of power plants and coolers.",

While, over time, as competition increased, their share of the ship market shrank, their components had earned a reputation for dependability and ease of maintenance. Their direct sales of these components soon made up the majority of the companies income and in 2513, the ceased ship manufacture entirely to focus on supplying industrial strength components.

While, over time, as competition increased, their share of the ship market shrank, their components had earned a reputation for dependability and ease of maintenance. Their direct sales of these components soon made up the majority of the companies income and in 2513, the ceased ship manufacture entirely to focus on supplying industrial strength components.

They downsized their craft production and turned to manufacturing parts. However, time heals all wounds and today Aegis has risen once again to be a top military contractor of ships and components.",

The second is a more recent usage in that it refers to the start-up manufacturing company who took the phrase as their epithet. ACOM focuses on creating ship components that handle as much power as possible as quickly as possible in order to give pilots the all-important extra edge during a race. Founded by the children of famed pit crew chief Garrit Bijarani, siblings Jayce and Zan took four generations of racing knowledge and gave it form in ACOM’s full line of power plants and coolers.",

While, over time, as competition increased, their share of the ship market shrank, their components had earned a reputation for dependability and ease of maintenance. Their direct sales of these components soon made up the majority of the companies income and in 2513, the ceased ship manufacture entirely to focus on supplying industrial strength components. In parts of the ’verse there are generations of mechanics who have passed knowledge and techniques for working on Juno power plants like family heirlooms.

Utilitarian above all us, these ships were designed to do one thing: haul as much weight as possible as cheaply as possible. While, over time, as competition increased, their share of the ship market shrank, their components had earned a reputation for dependability and ease of maintenance. Their direct sales of these components soon made up the majority of the companies income and in 2513, the ceased ship manufacture entirely to focus on supplying industrial strength components. In parts of the ’verse there are generations of mechanics who have passed knowledge and techniques for working on Juno power plants like family heirlooms. This long history also means that Juno parts and repairs are easy to come by.",

They have a wide variety of sizes and shapes that can be found in everything from land transports, to computer systems, to refrigerator units.
