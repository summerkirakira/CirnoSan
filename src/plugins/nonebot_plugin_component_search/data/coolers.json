Plus, their coolers can be found in more than just ships. They have a wide variety of sizes and shapes that can be found in everything from land transports, to computer systems, to refrigerator units. Appealing to the broader consumer market, their units might not have all the bells and whistles as some of the other manufacturer’s lines, but for the most part they avoid their quirks as well.","ref":"6cf93625-789a-4e8f-a857-325d64a58c93","calculatorName":"JSPN"}}},"localName":"cool_jspn_s03_winterstarxl_scitem"},{"calculatorType":"cooler","data":{"health":1000,"maxLifetimeHours":1080,"type":"Cooler","size":4,"grade":"A","name":"Serac","description":"Only available for Origin Jumpworks' luxury liner, Wen/Cassel specially designed the Serac cooler to keep the 890 Jump operational through the diverse conditions typically encountered while cruising the stars.","mass":640,"ref":"18600693-df8b-4898-a9a6-e91291e69dd4","heat":{"temperatureToIR":20,"startIRTemperature":250,"overpowerHeat":0.3,"overclockThresholdMinHeat":0.64,"overclockThresholdMaxHeat":0.77,"thermalEnergyBase":10,"thermalEnergyDraw":20,"thermalConductivity":3,"specificHeatCapacity":13,"mass":200,"surfaceArea":50,"startCoolingTemperature":300,"maxCoolingRate":1,"maxTemperature":450,"overheatTemperature":370,"recoveryTemperature":350,"minTemperature":0,"misfireMinTemperature":370,"misfireMaxTemperature":600},"power":{"powerBase":64,"powerDraw":96,"timeToReachDrawRequest":0,"safeguardPriority":30,"isThrottleable":false,"isOverclockable":false,"overclockThresholdMin":0.5,"overclockThresholdMax":0.7,"overpowerPerformance":0.25,"overclockPerformance":0.5,"powerToEM":10,"decayRateOfEM":0.15,"warningDelayTime":0.3,"warningDisplayTime":8},"distortion":{"decayDelay":1.5,"decayRate":69,"maximum":1143,"warningRatio":0.75,"recoveryRatio":0.62,"powerRatioAtMaxDistortion":false,"powerChangeOnlyAtMaxDistortion":false},"cooler":{"coolingRate":16000000,"suppressionIRFactor":0.1,"suppressionHeatFactor":0.1},"class":"Civilian","manufacturerData":{"calculatorType":"manufacturer","data":{"nameSmall":"WCPR","name":"Wen/Cassel Propulsion","description":"Subsidiary of RSI, handles a small percentage of their thruster and ship options construction as well as cooling systems.","ref":"d8ef0f35-e196-4d18-affa-750f6cdf8cb4","calculatorName":"WCPR"}}},"localName":"cool_orig_s04_890j_scitem"},{"calculatorType":"cooler","data":{"health":1325,"maxLifetimeHours":96,"type":"Cooler","size":2,"grade":"D","name":"HydroJet","description":"When your ship overheats, it makes just about any task not only more difficult, but potentially dangerous for you and your crew.

While, over time, as competition increased, their share of the ship market shrank, their components had earned a reputation for dependability and ease of maintenance. Their direct sales of these components soon made up the majority of the companies income and in 2513, the ceased ship manufacture entirely to focus on supplying industrial strength components. In parts of the ’verse there are generations of mechanics who have passed knowledge and techniques for working on Juno power plants like family heirlooms.
